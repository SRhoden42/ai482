# What is this about?

When I find an interesting article or video, I share it here. Most
of these are possible starting points for a short presentation, or
may be useful for your application research.

I usually look at the articles in some detail (though I rarely work
through them - that would be your job), and assign a label for the
difficulty level Lvl = 0 (simple), 1 (moderate), 2 (difficult), or 3
(hard).

Papers can be hard for different reason: length, technical
vocabulary, writing style, mathematics, number of citations etc. If
you find any of these interesting and want to use them for your
research, you might ask me why I assigned a particular level.

# Use of AI in smart buildings (LvL=2)

Literature reviews are among the most important papers, both for
beginners (to get an overview), and for experts (to keep their
overview) - because they wade through and evaluate many articles in
one fell swoop. You may still have to go back to the original
source, but no matter what, you'll have saved a lot of time, and
learnt a lot, because the authors of literature reviews are often
experts themselves (or becoming experts, by writing a literature
review). Also, a literature review should be a part of every paper
you write, and of every presentation you give.
